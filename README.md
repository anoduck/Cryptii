# Cryptii
An OpenSource web application used under the MIT license where you can convert, encrypt and decrypt content between different codes and formats. This happens fully in the browser using JavaScript with no server connection involved.

## Usage
You can include Cryptii as a library in your JavaScript project:

```javascript
var input = "Hello World";

var textFormat = new Cryptii.TextFormat();
textFormat.setContent(input);

console.log(textFormat.getSource());
// logs [72, 101, 108, 108, ...]

var rot13Format = new Cryptii.Rot13Format();
rot13Format.setOptionValue('variant', 'rot47');
rot13Format.setSource(textFormat.getSource());

console.log(rot13Format.getContent());
// logs "w6==@ (@C=5"
```
